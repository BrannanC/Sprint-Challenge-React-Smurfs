1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

    In server side routing, when the URL changes the server sends back a whole new document and refreshes the page. Server-side routing has been the standard and search engines are optimised for it.

    Client-side routing uses URLs to change the state of the application to render different views, but prevents a request to the server. Routing between views is generally faster because less data is processed and allows for smooth transitions and animations
